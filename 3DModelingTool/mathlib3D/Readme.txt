This zip file contains the "mathlib3D" library, consisting of
classes designed to support development of 3D graphics systems and games.

To use the library, extract the file "mathlib3D.jar" and add it to your
"CLASSPATH" variable.  (For example, in a Windows system if you store
the extracted mathlib3D.jar file at the root of the C: drive as "C:\mathlib3D.jar", then add "C:\mathlib3D.jar" to your CLASSPATH variable.)

The classes in the mathlib3D library are contained in a Java "package" named "mathlib3D"; you will need to add a statement like "import mathlib3D.*" to your classes to access the mathlib3D classes.

Be sure to note that the last character in the library name is an UPPER CASE 'D', not a lower-case 'd'; your CLASSPATH and "import" statements must use the proper case.

Documentation for the mathlib3D classes is contained in HTML pages in the "javadoc"
directory.  To use the documentation pages, extract the "javadoc" directory 
and open the file "index.html" in that directory in a browswer.
